Sourav Dutta is a Doctoral Researcher and PhD Candidate at the [Machine Learning](https://ml.cs.uni-kl.de/) research group at TU Kaiserslautern under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Sophie Burkhardt](https://ml.cs.uni-kl.de/people/sophie-burkhardt.html). His researcher interests include graph representations, probabilistic graphical models, and machine learning with graphs. He is also interested in applications of machine learning in chemical process engineering and natural language processing.

In April 2021, he received a Master’s degree (M.Sc.) in Language Science and Technology from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin where he worked on low-resource neural machine translation with [Prof. Dr. Josef van Genabith](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/about-us/employee/person/jova02/) and [Dr. Cristina España Bonet](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~cristinae/).
